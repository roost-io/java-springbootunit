# This scenario is testing the GET /products API endpoint. The expected behavior is that the API returns a 200 status code, and the response body contains a "products" property. The "products" property should be an empty array, indicating that there are no products. Additionally, the response body should contain "id", "name", "description", and "price" properties. The values of these properties should match the expected values.
