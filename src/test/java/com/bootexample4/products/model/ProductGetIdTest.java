ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getId_ba349b1eff
1. Scenario 1: Test if getId returns the correct id
TestName: testGetIdReturnsCorrectId
Description: This test checks if the getId() method returns the correct id that was set.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a specific id.
Act: Invoke the getId() method on the created instance.
Assert: Verify that the returned id matches the expected id.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the getId() method correctly retrieves the id that was set. This test is important to ensure that the class's id property is properly encapsulated and can be accessed correctly.
2. Scenario 2: Test if getId returns null when the id is not set
TestName: testGetIdReturnsNullWhenIdNotSet
Description: This test checks if the getId() method returns null when the id was not set.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the id.
Act: Invoke the getId() method on the created instance.
Assert: Verify that the returned id is null.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the getId() method behaves correctly when the id is not set. This test is important to ensure that the class's id property is properly encapsulated and can only be accessed when it is set.
3. Scenario 3: Test if getId returns the correct id when id is generated by the database
TestName: testGetIdReturnsCorrectIdWhenIdIsGeneratedByDatabase
Description: This test checks if the getId() method returns the correct id that was generated by the database.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the id, but with the necessary database configuration.
Act: Save the instance to the database, then retrieve it and invoke the getId() method on the retrieved instance.
Assert: Verify that the returned id matches the expected id that was generated by the database.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the getId() method correctly retrieves the id that was generated by the database. This test is important to ensure that the class's id property is properly encapsulated and can be accessed correctly after it is generated by the database.
4. Scenario 4: Test if getId returns the correct id when id is set by the constructor
TestName: testGetIdReturnsCorrectIdWhenIdIsSetByConstructor
Description: This test checks if the getId() method returns the correct id that was set by the constructor.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a specific id using the constructor.
Act: Invoke the getId() method on the created instance.
Assert: Verify that the returned id matches the expected id that was set by the constructor.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the getId() method correctly retrieves the id that was set by the constructor. This test is important to ensure that the class's id property is properly encapsulated and can be accessed correctly when it is set by the constructor.
5. Scenario 5: Test if getId returns the correct id when id is updated
TestName: testGetIdReturnsCorrectIdWhenIdIsUpdated
Description: This test checks if the getId() method returns the correct id that was updated.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a specific id, then update the id to a new value.
Act: Invoke the getId() method on the updated instance.
Assert: Verify that the returned id matches the expected id that was updated.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the getId() method correctly retrieves the updated id. This test is important to ensure that the class's id property is properly encapsulated and can be updated and accessed correctly.
