"Scenario 1: Validate retrieval of product ID
Details:
    TestName: getIdReturnsCorrectValue
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getId method correctly retrieves the product ID.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a Product object and set a known ID using setId.
    Act: Call the getId method on the Product object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned ID matches the known ID that was set.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getId method correctly retrieves the ID of the product. This is important as it ensures the correct product is identified when requested.

Scenario 2: Validate handling of null IDs
Details:
    TestName: getIdHandlesNullValue
    Description: This test is intended to check how the getId method handles a null ID.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a Product object without setting an ID.
    Act: Call the getId method on the Product object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned ID is null.
  Validation:
    This assertion checks that the getId method correctly handles null values, returning null when the product ID has not been set. This is crucial in avoiding NullPointerException errors in the application.

Scenario 3: Validate the persistence of product ID
Details:
    TestName: getIdRetainsValueAcrossCalls
    Description: This test is intended to verify that the getId method retains the same value across multiple calls.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a Product object and set a known ID using setId.
    Act: Call the getId method on the Product object multiple times.
    Assert: Assert that the ID returned is the same in each call.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getId method correctly retains the product ID across multiple calls. This is important as it ensures the consistency and reliability of product identification.

Scenario 4: Validate the uniqueness of product IDs
Details:
    TestName: getIdReturnsUniqueValuesForDifferentProducts
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getId method returns unique IDs for different products.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate two different Product objects and set unique IDs using setId.
    Act: Call the getId method on both Product objects.
    Assert: Assert that the IDs returned are different.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getId method correctly returns unique IDs for different products, which is essential for accurate product identification and differentiation.

Scenario 5: Validate ID value after update
Details:
    TestName: getIdReturnsUpdatedValueAfterSetId
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getId method returns the updated ID after setId is called.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a Product object, set an ID using setId, then update the ID with a new value.
    Act: Call the getId method on the Product object.
    Assert: Assert that the ID returned matches the updated ID.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getId method correctly returns the updated ID after setId is called, ensuring the product ID is always current and accurate.
