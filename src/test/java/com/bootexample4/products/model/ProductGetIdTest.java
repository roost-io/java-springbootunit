ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getId_ba349b1eff

Here are the generated test scenarios for the `getId()` method:

**Scenario 1: Get Id when Id is Null**

Details:
  TestName: getIdIsNull
  Description: Verify that the getId method returns null when the id field is null.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with id set to null.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit's assertNull to verify that the returned id is null.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the getId method correctly handles the scenario where the id field is null. This is an edge case that must be handled to prevent NullPointerExceptions.

**Scenario 2: Get Id when Id is Not Null**

Details:
  TestName: getIdIsNotNull
  Description: Verify that the getId method returns the correct id when the id field is not null.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with id set to a non-null value.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit's assertEquals to verify that the returned id matches the expected value.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the getId method correctly returns the id when it is not null. This is a basic functionality test to verify that the method works as expected.

**Scenario 3: Get Id immediately after Object Creation**

Details:
  TestName: getIdAfterObjectCreation
  Description: Verify that the getId method returns null immediately after object creation.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instance immediately after creation.
  Assert: Use JUnit's assertNull to verify that the returned id is null.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the getId method correctly returns null when the object is first created and the id field has not been set. This is an edge case that must be handled to prevent unexpected behavior.

**Scenario 4: Get Id after Setting Id**

Details:
  TestName: getIdAfterSettingId
  Description: Verify that the getId method returns the correct id after setting the id field.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the id field to a non-null value.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit's assertEquals to verify that the returned id matches the expected value.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the getId method correctly returns the id after it has been set. This is a basic functionality test to verify that the method works as expected.

These test scenarios cover various edge cases and error handling scenarios for the `getId()` method. By testing these scenarios, we can ensure that the method behaves as expected and handles unexpected cases correctly.
