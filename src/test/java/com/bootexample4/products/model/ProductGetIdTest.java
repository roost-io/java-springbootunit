Here are the test scenarios for the `getId` method:
**Scenario 1: Get Id of a Newly Created Object**
Details:
  TestName: testGetIdOfNewlyCreatedObject
  Description: This test verifies that the `getId` method returns `null` for a newly created object, as the `id` field is not initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class without setting any values.
  Act: Call the `getId` method on the newly created object.
  Assert: Use `assertNull` to verify that the returned `id` is `null`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `getId` method behaves correctly when the `id` field has not been initialized. This is significant because it verifies that the method does not return a default value or a random value, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the application.
**Scenario 2: Get Id of an Object with Initialized Id**
Details:
  TestName: testGetIdOfInitializedObject
  Description: This test verifies that the `getId` method returns the correct `id` value when it has been initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class and set the `id` field to a valid value (e.g., `1L`).
  Act: Call the `getId` method on the object.
  Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the returned `id` matches the initialized value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `getId` method correctly returns the `id` value when it has been set. This is significant because it verifies that the method behaves as expected when the `id` field has been initialized.
**Scenario 3: Get Id of an Object with Null Id**
Details:
  TestName: testGetIdOfObjectWithNullId
  Description: This test verifies that the `getId` method returns `null` when the `id` field is explicitly set to `null`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class and set the `id` field to `null`.
  Act: Call the `getId` method on the object.
  Assert: Use `assertNull` to verify that the returned `id` is `null`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `getId` method correctly handles the case where the `id` field is explicitly set to `null`. This is significant because it verifies that the method does not throw a `NullPointerException` or return a default value.
**Scenario 4: Get Id of an Object with Non-Primitive Id Type**
Details:
  TestName: testGetIdOfObjectWithNonPrimitiveIdType
  Description: This test verifies that the `getId` method correctly returns the `id` value when it is a non-primitive type (e.g., `Long`).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class and set the `id` field to a valid non-primitive value (e.g., `Long.valueOf(1)`).
  Act: Call the `getId` method on the object.
  Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the returned `id` matches the initialized value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `getId` method correctly handles non-primitive types. This is significant because it verifies that the method behaves as expected when working with object references.
**Scenario 5: Get Id of an Object with Multiple Fields Initialized**
Details:
  TestName: testGetIdOfObjectWithMultipleFieldsInitialized
  Description: This test verifies that the `getId` method correctly returns the `id` value when multiple fields are initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class and set multiple fields (e.g., `id`, `name`, and `description`) to valid values.
  Act: Call the `getId` method on the object.
  Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the returned `id` matches the initialized value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `getId` method correctly returns the `id` value even when multiple fields are initialized. This is significant because it verifies that the method behaves as expected in a real-world scenario where multiple fields are often set.
